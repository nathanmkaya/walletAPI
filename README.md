## Simple Wallet API
Write a simple wallet REST API.
We expect the following:
1. account deposits
2. account withdraws
3. balance enquiry
4. Mini statement

Added advantage:
1. Using Go Modules
2. Using Postgres.
3. Unit tests
4. Code coverage on the tests

Clearly document how to set up and run your application.
